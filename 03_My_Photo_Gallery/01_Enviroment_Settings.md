In this part we will start a new project!! 

**Project Description:** 

In this project we will be creating an simple image gallery that teaches kids:

- Colors 
- Fruits
- Pets 

We will just implement 3 pictures for each one to understand the project idea.> This time we will put the source code alone rather than showing each time, it's there if you need it.
